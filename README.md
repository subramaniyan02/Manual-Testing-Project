Manual Testing Project: Open cart

https://demo.opencart.com/

1) I played a key role in a manual testing project that focused on the Open 
Cart software application. My responsibilities included developing a 
comprehensive test plan, test cases, and test scenarios to ensure thorough 
coverage of the software's functionalities. 
2) I conducted systematic manual test execution, identifying and reporting 
any defects, inconsistencies, and usability issues that I found. 
Additionally, I performed regression testing after each software update 
and maintained a regression test suite.
3) Another important aspect of my work was evaluating the user interface 
(UI) of the software for user-friendliness and providing feedback for 
improvements. I also conducted data validation tests to ensure data 
integrity by comparing outputs to expected results. Throughout the 
project, I maintained detailed test documentation, including test cases, 
test plans, and test summary reports.
4) To validate complete workflows, I conducted end-to-end testing, and I 
also conducted compliance testing to ensure that the software met 
industry regulations.
